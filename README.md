Matlab Portfolio UH

This is a portfolio where I store my MATLAB code from projects I worked on while pursuing my Bachelors of Mathematics at the University of Houston:

This includes code from courses such as MATH 4364 Numerical Analysis. Topics Covered in this course:

This is an one semester course which introduces core areas of numerical analysis and scientific computing along with basic themes such as solving nonlinear equations, interpolation and splines fitting, curve fitting, numerical differentiation and integration, initial value problems of ordinary differential equations, direct methods for solving linear systems of equations, and finite-difference approximation to a two-points boundary value problem. This is an introductory course and will be a mix of mathematics and computing.

1. Computer Number Systems and Floating Point Arithmetic Conversion from base 10 to base 2,  conversion from base 2 to base 10, floating point systems and round-off errors.

2. Solutions of Equations in One Variable:
    Bisection method, fixed-point iteration, Newton's method, the secant method and their error analysis.

3. Direct Methods for Solving Linear Systems:
    Gaussian elimination with backward substitution, pivoting strategies, LU-factorization and forward substitution., Crout factorization.

4. Interpolation and polynomial approximation:
    Interpolation and the Lagrange polynomial, errors in polynomial interpolation, divided differences, Cubic spline interpolation, curve fitting.

5. Numerical differentiation and integration:
    Numerical differentiation, numerical integration, composite numerical integration, Gaussian quadratures, multiple integrals.

6. Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):
    Euler's Method, higher-order Taylor methods, Runge'Kutta methods, multi-step methods and its stability, stiff differential equations, two-points boundary value problem.
